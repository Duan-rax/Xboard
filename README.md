## 📖 Introduction

Xboard is a modern panel system built on Laravel 12, focusing on providing a clean and efficient user experience.

## 🏷️ Fork milestone

This fork is released as coordinated panel and node versions. The current
milestone is **v2026.10.30**.

- Managed egress profiles can be created, edited, tested and batch-bound to
  nodes from an embedded **出站管理** page.
- Binding changes are pushed to nodes and confirmed through an applied-config
  acknowledgement flow.
- The node hot-swaps the selected outbound without restarting its kernel or
  disconnecting the control-plane WebSocket.
- The companion node release is available from
  [Duan-rax/Xboard-Node](https://github.com/Duan-rax/Xboard-Node/releases).

See [managed egress administration](./docs/egress-management.md) and the
[changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).

## 📦 Releases

Releases use date-based immutable tags such as `v2026.10.30`. A `v*` tag runs
GitHub Actions to build the multi-architecture panel image, push it to GHCR,
and create the GitHub Release. Branch pushes do not replace release images.

2. For aaPanel installations, restart the Octane daemon process
